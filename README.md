README Reflection (CS 250 Sprint Review and Retrospective)

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by translating stakeholder requests into a prioritized backlog and then writing user stories that focus on user value plus measurable outcomes. In my Sprint Review and Retrospective, I used user stories and test cases together so “done” was observable through acceptance expectations and pass/fail results, which reduced rework and ambiguity. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development iteratively, using short cycles to clarify requirements, build a small increment, and validate it right away. Scrum supports this by pulling SDLC work into each sprint through backlog refinement, sprint planning, development, and immediate testing, so feedback can shape the next set of priorities instead of waiting until the end. Going forward, I want to keep using a prioritized backlog, user stories with acceptance criteria, sprint planning, continuous testing, and regular sprint reviews and retrospectives to inspect and adapt. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means showing up with clarity, accountability, and communication so the whole team can deliver together. In this project, that looked like contributing across roles, removing blockers as Scrum Master, and asking specific questions that turn confusion into testable decisions. It also means being adaptable when priorities change, like when the project pivoted and we reprioritized work instead of restarting. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
